CatMapApp
=========

A silly example of an ArcGIS Online Webmap application using cats. Ths app was inspired after seeing [this sneeze-inducing basemap](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c256d4a2110847aebc43ab5b9534cd87) provided by [Jonah Adkins](https://github.com/jonahadkins). This application uses the ArcGIS JavaScript API provided by ESRI to show a map, and add random cat features and popups all over the map. It also plays cat audio using Modernizr.

## Use instructions
- Turn the volume of your desktop computer or tablet up.
- In the browser, navigate to [http://raykendo.github.io/CatMapApp](http://raykendo.github.io/CatMapApp)
- Once the map has loaded, click on some of the cat paws on the map
- Enjoy.
